# Note Taker 

This is a Note Taker that can be used to add some Notes and Delete them.

Creating the Repository, Clone it.

Node.js is required to run.

npm install to install the required npm package.


## Functionality:

Usage of GET and POST are so important for this challenge.
Read, Write and Delete Functions are the most important part of the coding.
Also adding new note from req.body, push the object from req.body to the array
and Write the new array into the db.json file. 
Then we have to run the node.js file and see the result in localhost
I also created a Video which shows the process of running in Terminal and localhost.
